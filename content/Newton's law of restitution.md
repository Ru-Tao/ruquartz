### Formula
Newtons law of restitution states that

$$
\frac{\text{speed of seperation of particles}}{\text{speed of approach of particles}}=e
$$
Where the constant $e$ is the coefficient of restitution between the colliding particles.

- In a perfect elastic collision, $e=$, so the speed of separation = speed of approach
- In a inelastic collision, $e=0$, so the particles join together, as the speed of separation = 0.

Newton's law of restitution is often used alongside [[Momentum#Conservation of Momentum|conservation of momentum]] in a lot of [[Direct Impacts|direct impact]] questions.
