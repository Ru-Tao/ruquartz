- The modulus-argument form of a complex number can be used to rewrite the complex number in the exponential form, $z=re^{i\theta}$. 

### Euler's Relation

$$
e^{i\theta}=(\cos{\theta}+i\sin{\theta})
$$
- You can use Euler's relation and the modulus-argument form to write a complex number $z$ in an exponential form.
$$
z=re^{i\theta}
$$

- Where, $r=|z|$ and $\theta=\arg{z}$.   

###### Euler's Identiy
- When subsituting $\theta=\pi$ and rearranging in [[Complex Numbers#Euler's Relation|Euler's relation]], we get Euler's Identity.
$$
e^{i\pi}+1=0
$$

#### Expansions of $\cos{\theta}$, $\sin{\theta}$ and $e^x$
- Both $\cos{\theta}$ and $\sin{\theta}$ can be written as an infinite series of powers of $\theta$.

$$
\cos{\theta}=1-\frac{\theta^2}{2!}+\frac{\theta^4}{4!}-\frac{\theta^6}{6!}...
$$

$$
\sin{\theta}=\frac{\theta}{1!}-\frac{\theta^3}{3!}+\frac{\theta^5}{5!} - \frac{\theta^7}{7!} ...
$$

- Both of the series for $\sin{\theta}$ and $\cos{\theta}$ are found from the [[Maclaurin series expansions]] of each function. 
- An $e^x$ can also be written in a similar infinite expansion.
