> [!question] Question 2
>A pile driver of mass 1000kg drives a pile of mass 200kg vertically into the ground. The driver falls freely a vertical distance of 10m before hitting the pile. Immediately after the driver impacts with the pile it can be assumed that they both move with the same velocity. By modelling the pile and the driver as particles, find:
>
>a) The speed of the driver immediately before it hits the pile
>>[!todo]- Answer
>>
>>- For part **a**, [[suvat]] is actually to be used, as we are given the distance, and we're looking for the final speed of the driver before it hits the pile, $v$. 
>>- The starting speed, $u$, can be assumed to be 0 as it's falling from rest, 
>>- The acceleration, $a$, being $g$ or $9.8$ as its falling.
>>
>>$$s=10\\ u=0\\ v=?\\ a=9.8\\ t=N/A$$
>>
>>Knowing these three values, we can use the suvat equation $v^2=u^2+2as$ and find the value of $v$.
>>$$v^2=0^2+2(9.8)(10)$$
>>$$v^2=196\\ v=14$$
>
>
>b) The common speed of the pile and the driver immediately after the impact. 
>>[!todo]- Answer
>>
>>- To find the common speed, we can use [[Momentum#Conservation of Momentum|conservation of momentum]]. 
>>- For the driver we have its mass, $m_1$, as 1000.
>>- Its speed, $u_1$, being 14m/s, as found in part **a**. 
>>- For the pile we also have its mass, $m_2$,
>>- and its speed, $u_2$, of $0$. 
>>- As for $v_1$ and $v_2$ as both the pile and the driver fall together with the same velocity, I'll just label it $v$ (separate from the $v$ in part **a**).
>>This gives us the equation,
>>$$14(1000)=1000v+200v$$
>>$$14000=1200v$$
>>$$\frac{14000}{1200}=v$$
>>$$\frac{35}{3}=v$$
>
>The ground provides a constant resistance of 120000N to the motion of the pile driver.
>c) Find the distance that the pile is driven into the ground before coming to a rest.
>> [!todo]- Answer
>>
>>Here we actually have to use both the aforementioned [[suvat]] and the formula for [[Force|force]]. Using the formula $F=ma$, we can find the force that pile and the driver combined exerts, 
>>$$F=(1200)(9.8)$$
>>$$F=11760$$
>>And taking away this value from the force exerted by the ground we can then find the overall force of the equation.
>>$11760-120000=-108240$
>>With this value we can find the overall acceleration, once again using $F=ma$.
>>$-108240=1200(a)$
>>$a=-\frac{108240}{1200}$
>>$a=-90.2$
>>Here is where we use suvat again to find the distance, $s$. 
>>$s=?$
>>$u=\frac{35}{3}$
>>$v=0$ as it comes to a stop.
>>$a=-90.2$
>>$t=N/A$
