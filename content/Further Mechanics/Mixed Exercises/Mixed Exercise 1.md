> [!question] Question 2
>A pile driver of mass 1000kg drives a pile of mass 200kg vertically into the ground. The driver falls freely a vertical distance of 10m before hitting the pile. Immediately after the driver impacts with the pile it can be assumed that they both move with the same velocity. By modelling the pile and the driver as particles, find:
>
>a) The speed of the driver immediately before it hits the pile
>>[!todo]- Answer
>>
>>For part **a**, [[suvat]] is actually to be used, as we are given the distance, and we're looking for the final speed of the driver before it hits the pile, $v$. The starting speed, $u$, can be assumed to be 0 as it's beginning its fall, and the acceleration, $a$, being $g$ or $9.8$,
>>$$s=10\\ u=0\\ v=?\\ a=9.8\\ t=N/A$$
>>
>>Knowing these three values, we can use the suvat equation $v^2=u^2+2as$ and find the value of $v$.
>>$$v^2=0^2+2(9.8)(10)$$
>>$$v^2=196\\ v=14$$
>
>
>b) The common speed of the pile and the driver immediately after the impact. 
>>[!todo]- Answer
>>
>>To find the common speed, we can use [[Momentum#Conservation of Momentum|conservation of momentum]], and its formula. For the driver we have its mass, $m_1$, as 1000 and its speed, $u_1$, being 14m/s, as found in part **a**. For the pile we also have its mass, $m_2$, and its extraordinary speed, $u_2$, of $0$. As for $v_1$ and $v_2$ as they're the same I'll just call them $v$ (separate from the $v$ in part **a**).
>>This gives us the equation,
>>$$14(1000)=1000v+200v$$
>>$$14000=1200v$$
>>$$\frac{14000}{1200}=v$$
>>$$\frac{35}{3}=v$$
