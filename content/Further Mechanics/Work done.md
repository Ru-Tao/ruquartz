- If an object has energy it can do work.
- Work is the transfer of energy from one place to another
- Work is done by a force when it moves an object

$$
\text{Work}=Fs
$$
- Work is given in Joules ($J$).
- In Further Mechanics 1 Work is only considering a constant force.

 Example 2
 A package of mass $2kg$ is pulled at a constant speed up a rough plane which is inclined at $30\degree$ to the horizontal. The coefficient of friction between the package and the surface is $0.35$. The package is pulled up $12m$ along the greatest slope of the plane.  
a) Find the work done against gravity.
- To begin we can establish that the parcel has a mass of $2kg$, so the overall force being acted downwards on the plane is $2g$ where $g$ is the [[gravitational constant]] of 9.8.
- To solve for the work done, we need to find the force, $2g$, in the parallel and perpendicular to the plane.
- In this case as were finding the work done against gravity, we can find the the downwards force caused by the parcel that's going down the plane.
- The parallel case would be

$$
2g\sin{30}
$$
Where $\sin30=\frac{1}{2}$, so the parallel force would just be

$$
g
$$
- To find the Work done by this force, we have the distance so we can just apply the [[Work done| work done formula]].

$$
Work=12g
$$

$$
Work=117.6J
$$
So the overall work done against gravity would be $117.6J$. 

b) The work done against friction.

Answer

- Similarly to finding the work done against gravity, here we have to find the friction
