- If an object has energy it can do work.
- Work is the transfer of energy from one place to another
- Work is done by a force when it moves an object

$$
\text{Work}=Fs
$$
- Work is given in Joules ($J$).
- In Further Mechanics 1 Work is only considering a constant force.

>[!question]+ Example 1

>>- As we have both the force and distance, in this  example we can use the formula to simply multiply the two to find the work done.

>>Work=5\times8
>>$$
>>$$
>>Work=40J
>>$$
>>So the overall work done is 40J.
