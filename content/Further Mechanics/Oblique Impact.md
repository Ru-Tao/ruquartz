An oblique impact is one where the particle does not strike the surface at a normal, or $90\degree$ angle. 
Here you can use $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to represent the angles between the particles movement and the surface, before and after impact.

$$
v\sin{\beta}=eu\sin{\alpha}
$$

$$
v\sin{\beta}=u\cos{\alpha}
$$
