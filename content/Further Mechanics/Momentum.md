The momentum of an object with mass $m$ moving at a velocity of $v$ is $mv$.
- If the mass is in kg and velocity is m/s the unit of momentum will be kg m/s.
- Momentum can also be measured in Newton Seconds, $Ns$, as kg m/s$^2$ is the unit for [[Force]], and taking out kg m/s$^2$ from kg m/s it becomes (kg m/s$^2$)s which is equal to $Ns$ 

$$
Momentum = Mass \times Velocity \newline 

Momentum = mv
$$


> [!question] a) A cricket ball of Mass $400g$ is moving at $18m/s$,
> Find the magnitude of momentum.
>>[!todo]- Answer
>>
>> Momentum = Mass x Velocity
>> $0.4 \times 18 = 7.2$ 
>> $7.2$ kg m/s or $7.2 Ns$ 

>[!question] b) A lorry of mass $5$ tonnes moving at $0.3ms$
>Find the magnitude of momentum.
>>[!todo]- Answer
>>
>> $1$ tonne = $1000kg$ 
>> $5000 \times 0.3 = 1500$
>> $=1500$kg m/s or $1500Ns$

## Conservation of Momentum
As Newton's 3rd law states, when two bodies collide, each one exerts and equal and opposite force on the other. They must both exert an [[Impulse]] on the other of equal magnitude, but in opposing directions. 

The changes of momentum are equal, but the direction is opposite, and as a result the changes of momentum cancel each other out, and the overall change is 0.

**Total momentum before impact = total momentum after impact**
$$m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} = m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2}$$
</big> 


> [!info] Conservation of momentum Example
> A particle $P$ of mass $2$kg is moving with speed $3m/s$ on a smooth horizontal plane. Particle Q of mass $3kg$ is at rest on the plane. Particle $P$ collides with particle $Q$ and after collision $Q$ moves off with speed $\frac{7}{3}m/s$.

>>
>> $I = mv-mu$ 
>> $I = (2)(-\frac{1}{2})-(2)(3)$
>> $I = (2)(-\frac{1}{2})-(2)(3)$
>> $I = -7$
>> So the impulse recieved by $P$ has a magnitude of $7Ns$. 

# Momentum as a [[Vector]]
Both [[Impulse]] and [[Momentum]] are vectors, as a result you can write both the [[Impulse#Impulse momentum principle.|Impulse momentum principle]] and the [[Momentum#Conservation of Momentum|conservation of momentum]] as vector equations. 

>[!question] Example
>A particle of mass $0.2$kg is moving with the velocity $(10i-5j)m/s$ when it receives an impulse of $(3i-2j)Ns$. Find the new velocity of the particle.

> <small> Taken from Edexcel Further Mechanics 1, Chapter 1 Example 8 </small>
>>[!todo]- Answer 
>>
>>Using the [[Impulse#Impulse momentum principle.|impulse momentum principle]], where $m=0.2$ and $u=(10i-5j)$ we can form the equation
>>$$(3i-2j)=0.2v-0.2(10i-5j)$$
>>$(3i-2j)=0.2v-(2i-j)$
>>$(5i-3j)=0.2v$
>>$(25i-15j)=v$
>>So the new velocity would be the vector v, $(25i-15j)$.

> [!note]- Ripen's comments
> Every time I see the word "vectors" in any topic I start sweating, I always expect it to be something like 3D vectors or worse, but it's always usually just 2D. There was a funny time in normal maths where we were covering vectors, and during the lesson I was super focused since I feel like vectors is my worst topic, however everything during the lesson was actually a breeze and I just expected worse then what was actually taught. I guess Core Pure 1 vectors just traumatised me that badly.
