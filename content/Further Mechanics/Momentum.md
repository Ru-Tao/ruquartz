The momentum of an object with mass $m$ moving at a velocity of $v$ is $mv$.
- If the mass is in kg and velocity is m/s the unit of momentum will be kg m/s.
- Momentum can also be measured in Newton Seconds, $Ns$, as kg m/s$^2$ is the unit for [[Force]], and taking out kg m/s$^2$ from kg m/s it becomes (kg m/s$^2$)s which is equal to $Ns$ 

<big> $Momentum = Mass \times Velocity$ </big>
<big> $Momentum = mv$ </big>

First example, 

a) A cricket ball of Mass $400g$ is moving at $18m/s$,
Find the magnitude of momentum.
**$\quad$** Momentum = Mass x Velocity
**$\quad$** $0.4 \times 18 = 7.2$ 
**$\quad$** $7.2$ kg m/s or $7.2 Ns$ 

b) A lorry of mass $5$ tonnes moving at $0.3ms$
Find the magnitude of momentum.
**$\quad$** $1$ tonne = $1000kg$ 
**$\quad$** $5000 \times 0.3 = 1500$
**$\quad$** $=1500$kg m/s or $1500Ns$

# Conservation of Momentum
As Newton's 3rd law states, when two bodies collide, each one exerts and equal and opposite force on the other. They must both exert an [[Impulse]] on the other of equal magnitude, but in opposing directions. 

The changes of momentum are equal, but the direction is opposite, and as a result the changes of momentum cancel each other out, and the overall change is 0.

**Total momentum before impact = total momentum after impact**
