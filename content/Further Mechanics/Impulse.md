If a constant force, $F$, acts for some time, $t$, then the impulse of the force is $Ft$
# Impulse = [[Force]] $\times$ Time
## Impulse $(Ft)=F \times t$ 
	Force is measured in Newtons.
	Time is measured in Seconds.


Using the form of $F = m(\frac{v-u}{t})$, impulse can also be given as $I = m(v-u)$ or more concisely, $I = mv-mu$.
	Impulse = final momentum - initial momentum
	Impulse = the change in momentum
