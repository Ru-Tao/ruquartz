If a constant force, $F$, acts for some time, $t$, then the impulse of the force is $Ft$

Impulse = [[Force]] $\times$ Time

$$
I=F \times t
$$
<small>Force is measured in Newtons.
Time is measured in Seconds.</small>


Using the form of $F = m(\frac{v-u}{t})$, impulse can also be given as $I = m(v-u)$ or more concisely, this is known as the 
##### Impulse momentum principle.
$$
I = mv-mu
$$

Impulse = final momentum - initial momentum
Impulse = the change in momentum
