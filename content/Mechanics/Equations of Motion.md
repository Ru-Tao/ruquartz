Equations of motions, or also known as **suvat**, are a group of linked equations all made up of 5 values.
$$s=\text{Distance (metres)}$$
$$u=\text{Initial Velocity} \text{ (metres per second)}$$
$$v=\text{Final Velocity/Velocity at } t \text{ (metres per second)}$$
$$ a = \text{Acceleration (metres per second}^2\text{)}$$
$$t=\text{Time (seconds)}$$
It's also worth noting that $s, u, v$ and $a$ are all [[Vectors]] quantities, and their sign shows their direction. 
## Equations
$$v=u+at$$
$$s=(\frac{u+v}{2})t$$
$$v^2=u^2+2as$$
$$s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at$$
$$s=vt-\frac{1}{2}at$$

>- It's always a good idea to define the direction that is positive and negative, which can come useful in a question where an object can move back and forth, for example a ball being thrown into the air and hitting the ground.
>- Often the point in which an object moving upwards is at it's highest is when their final velocity, $v$, is at 0, as this is usually the turning point. 
>- Often diagrams are worth drawing just to get a grasp of the situation.
>- Suvat is only useful in questions with constant acceleration.
>- If an object starts at "rest", $u$ is often  $0m/s$, and if it ends at rest, $v$ can often be taken as $0m/s$.
>- In the case an object is falling, its acceleration is equal to the constant $g$, of gravity, which can be approximated as $9.8$.
