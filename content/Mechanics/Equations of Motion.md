Equations of motions, or also known as **suvat**, are a group of linked equations all made up of 5 values.
$$s=\text{Distance (metres)}$$
$$u=\text{Initial Velocity} \text{ (metres per second)}$$
$$v=\text{Final Velocity/Velocity at } t \text{ (metres per second)}$$
$$ a = \text{Acceleration (metres per second}^2\text{)}$$
$$t=\text{Time (seconds)}$$
It's also worth noting that $s, u, v$ and $a$ are all [[Vectors]] quantities, and their sign shows their direction. 
## Equations
$$v=u+at$$
$$s=(\frac{u+v}{2})t$$
$$v^2=u^2+2as$$
$$s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at$$
$$s=vt-\frac{1}{2}at$$
