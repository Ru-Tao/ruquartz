Vector quantities are values that have both direction and magnitude, for example some values that are vector equations are:
- Displacement
- Velocity
- [[Acceleration]]
- [[Momentum]]
- [[Force]]
In each vector quantity the sign dictates the direction of movement.
For example if a force is heading in direction $\rightarrow$, a negative value of a force in the same question would be moving opposite, meaning it would move in the direction $\leftarrow$.

### Vector Notation

#### 2D Vectors
Sometimes two dimensional vector equations can also be given in vector notation. 

This means a two dimensional vector can be given in the form 

$$
ai+bj
$$

Where $i$ is one unit in the x axis ($\rightarrow$) and $j$ is one unit in the y axis ($\uparrow$).
This form is also equivalent to the form.

$$
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
$$


#### 3D Vectors

Vectors in three dimensions can also be given in vector notation similarly to [[Vectors#2D Vectors|two dimensional vectors]].

This means a three dimensional vector can be given in the form:

$$
ai+bj+ck
$$

Where now $k$ accounts for one unit in the z axis.
This form is equivalent, similarly in 2D vectors, to the form:

$$
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix}
$$
